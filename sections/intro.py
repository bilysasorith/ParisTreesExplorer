        I grew up in Paris, surrounded by trees I never truly noticed.<br>
        They were always there <b>quiet sentinels rooted in stone and history</b>, watching generations come and go.<br>

        Through the changing seasons, theyâ€™ve offered shade, oxygen, and beauty â€” a quiet form of care we rarely acknowledge.<br>
        Yet, despite their presence, Iâ€™ve come to realize how little I know about them, and about the <b>urban ecosystem</b> that sustains our lives.<br>

        To understand our environment is, in many ways, to understand ourselves.<br>
        And in Paris, this reflection raises an uncomfortable question:<br>
        <b>Do all Parisians breathe the same air â€” or does nature draw its borders too?</b>
